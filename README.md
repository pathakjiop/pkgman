## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Arch Linux (or Arch-based distro) | Manjaro, EndeavourOS, etc. work fine |
| Rust toolchain (`cargo`, `rustc`) | Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| `pacman` | Ships with Arch — you already have it |
| `yay` or `paru` *(optional)* | Required for AUR operations |
| `curl` *(optional)* | Required for homepage fetch and script preview |

### Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pathakjiop/pkgman.git
cd pkgman

# Build an optimized release binary
cargo build --release

# Install to your local bin
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp target/release/pkgman ~/.local/bin/pkgman
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/pkgman
```

> **Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`** — add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
> ```bash
> export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
> ```

### Optimized release profile *(optional but recommended)*

Add to your `Cargo.toml` for maximum runtime performance:

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
strip = true
```

---

## Configuration

`pkgman` reads its config from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pkgman/config.toml` (defaults to `~/.config/pkgman/config.toml`).

The file is **created automatically on first run** — `aur` is seeded to `true` if `yay` or `paru` is found, `false` otherwise. Once it exists, it is **never overwritten**. Manual edits are always respected.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `aur` | bool | `true` | When `false`: AUR DB skipped, searches return a disabled notice, installs/updates route through `pacman` only |

**Example — pacman-only mode:**
```toml
# ~/.config/pkgman/config.toml
aur = false
```

---

## AUR cache warm-up

`pkgman` loads 114,000+ AUR packages in under 10ms by reading your AUR helper's shell completion cache directly:

| Helper | Cache path |
|--------|-----------|
| `yay` | `~/.cache/yay/completion.cache` |
| `paru` | `~/.cache/paru/completion.cache` |

If AUR packages aren't appearing, warm up the cache first:

```bash
# yay
yay -Sl aur > /dev/null

# paru
paru -Sl aur > /dev/null
```

---

## Keyboard reference

> Press `?` inside pkgman at any time to open the interactive help overlay.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `k` | Move cursor up |
| `↓` / `j` | Move cursor down |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll full page |
| `J` / `K` | Scroll details pane |
| `1` – `7` | Switch filter tabs |
| `/` | Enter live search mode |
| `Ctrl+X` | Clear search query |
| `Esc` | Exit search / close overlay |
| `Space` | Toggle package selection |
| `i` | Install selected package(s) |
| `r` | Remove selected package(s) |
| `u` | System upgrade (`-Syu`) |
| `d` | Fetch package homepage (async) |
| `E` | Preview shell script safely |
| `R` | Reload package databases (async) |
| `s` | Cycle sort mode |
| `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `q` | Quit |

## Theming

> 🚧 **Work in progress** — theming support is actively being developed.

A full theming system is planned that will allow full control over colors, pane styles, and status indicator glyphs via the config file. Stay tuned — contributions welcome (see below).

---

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. To keep things clean and mergeable, please follow these conventions.

### Branch naming

All work branches must follow this pattern:

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat/` | New feature or capability |
| `fix/` | Bug fix |
| `theme/` | Theming-related work |
| `docs/` | Documentation only |
| `refactor/` | Code restructure, no behavior change |
| `perf/` | Performance improvement |
| `chore/` | Tooling, CI, dependencies |
| `test/` | Tests only |

**Examples:**
```
feat/theme-engine
fix/aur-cache-fallback
docs/contributing-guide
refactor/event-loop-cleanup
theme/catppuccin-mocha
```

> ⚠️ PRs from branches that don't match this pattern will be asked to rename before review.

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/pathakjiop/pkgman.git
cd pkgman

# 2. Create your branch from main
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# 3. Make your changes, commit with a clear message
git commit -m "feat: add catppuccin theme support"

# 4. Push and open a PR against main
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

### Commit message format

Follow the conventional commit style:

```
<type>: <short imperative description>

Optional longer body explaining the why, not the what.
```

### PR checklist

Before opening a PR, make sure:

- [ ] `cargo build --release` succeeds with no warnings
- [ ] Your branch name follows the naming convention above
- [ ] Changes are scoped — one concern per PR
- [ ] You've updated documentation if behavior changed
- [ ] For new features, a brief description is in the PR body

### Good first issues

Look for issues tagged [`good first issue`](https://github.com/pathakjiop/pkgman/issues?q=label%3A"good+first+issue") — these are intentionally scoped for newcomers.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Theming engine** — full color/style customization via `config.toml`
- [ ] **Built-in theme presets** — Catppuccin, Nord, Gruvbox, Tokyo Night
- [ ] **Mouse support** — optional click-to-select
- [ ] **AUR comment viewer** — inline AUR comments and flag status
- [ ] **Dependency tree visualizer** — graphical dep tree in the details pane
- [ ] **AUR PKGBUILD diff viewer** — diff updates before installing
